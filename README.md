# Steam Trading Card Set Pricer

This project creates overviews of Steam trading card prices. Data is parsed from the Steam Market. You can view the most recent data [here](http://ianharmon.github.io/steam-card-pricer/).

It runs on Python (tested on 3.3) with no dependencies and generates the HTML in-place. It would probably run well on a dedicated server with a cron job.
